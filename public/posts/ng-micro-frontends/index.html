        <p>In 1 hour and 42 minutes you can learn how to implement the same web component-based micro frontend architecture that we've been using to ship micro frontends in production for nearly two years at LeanIX:</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="ee17YczpCpU" videotitle="Web Component-based Micro Frontends with Angular"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>This is the largest video project on a technical topic that I've produced so far and it was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Together with <a href="https://traveling-coderman.net/" target="_blank">Fabian BÃ¶ller</a>, the main author of the implementation for micro frontends using web components with Angular elements at LeanIX, we share:</p>
<ul>
<li>Migrating a sub-route of an Angular application from a lazy loaded route to a micro frontend in a web component.</li>
<li>Deploying and integrating the shell application and the micro frontend on Netlify.</li>
<li>Building a new top level route inside the micro frontend.</li>
<li>And many more things to know about shipping micro frontends with Angular in production.</li>
</ul>
<p>By adopting micro frontends at LeanIX, we enabled a very high level of autonomy to our cross-functional teams, as they can ship their frontend and backend independently from those of other teams. No more blocked release pipelines due to failing tests in the frontend monolith.<br>
This is also known as vertical team ownership. You can read more about it on <a href="https://micro-frontends.org/" target="_blank">micro-frontends.org</a>.</p>
<p>During the recording we made commits for each major step of the micro frontend migration. You can find the source code and the exact commits from the Video on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/fboeller/microfrontends-with-angular/commits/recording">microfrontends-with-angular project on GitHub</a></p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/ManfredSteyer" target="_blank">Manfred Steyer</a> for building and mainting the <a href="https://github.com/manfredsteyer/ngx-build-plus" target="_blank">ngx-build-plus</a> npm package.<br>
It makes it easy to combine the build output of an Angular application into a single JavaScript file, which is essential for including them as web-components.</p>
