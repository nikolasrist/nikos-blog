Hi! Welcome to my website.
This page is the place I use to share my knowledge, interests in the scope of programming and everything related to that.
I have a masters degree in Computer Science, and like to solve hard problems.

Right now I am working as a Senior Software Engineer in the engineering [@LeanIX](https://engineering.leanix.net).

In the past I worked in the area of chemoinformatics during my bachelors degree and some other places. This will be added in the future in the following section.
